Sirius Chain is a powerful distributed ledger technology and it can be even more powerful with a storage extensions. 
Sirius-Storage version 1 is a fork of IPFS and with it alongside Sirius Chain creates a powerful integration that provides
a more fault tolerant mechanism for handling data.

## Sirius Chain and DFMS Integration
Using these technologies, we can build a solid, bullet proof file system that has the security and reliability of 
blockchain and the immutability and availability of peer to peer storage network. Combining these two technologies 
opens up a new breed of innovative applications. Ranging from KYC, Health Record Management, Identity IOT, Big Data to 
immutable websites, notary services and reporting systems.

## Software Development Kits and Libraries
In order to integrate this two technologies, we developed software development kits across different main stream programming platform.
