title: Sirius-Storage DFMS version extension
---

Sirius Chain is a powerful distributed ledger technology and it can be even more powerful with storage extensions. 
Sirius-Storage version 1 is a fork of IPFS and alongside Sirius Chain, it creates a powerful integration that provides
a more fault tolerant mechanism for handling data.

## Sirius Chain and DFMS Integration
Using these technologies, we can build a solid, bulletproof file system that has the security and reliability of 
blockchain as well as the immutability and availability of a peer-to-peer storage network. Combining these two technologies 
opens up a new breed of innovative applications, ranging from KYC, Health Record Management, Identity IOT, Big Data to 
immutable websites, notary services and reporting systems.

## Software Development Kits and Libraries
In order to integrate these two technologies, we developed software development kits across different mainstream programming platforms.
