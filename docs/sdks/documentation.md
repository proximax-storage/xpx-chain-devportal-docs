SDKs need to be adopted by other developers. As a contributor, no one knows better than you how a determined SDK works. Provide the content for its documentation to help spread the use of your SDK. 

## Readme

Check if your repository has a complete Readme Notes. Consider using the template <a href="/downloads/README_SDK.md" >here</a> used by some SDKs.

Required sections are the following:

- Requirements
- Installation
- Contributing
- License

## Comments and Reference Docs

Document the functions and classes with the comments while you write your code. A reference generator should be able to read this comments and generate HTML as an output.

Some examples of reference generators are [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/) for GO, whereas in Java we are using [Javadoc](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javadoc-137458.html). Research which is the reference generator most convenient for your language.

## Guides 

The ProximaX Sirius Chain Developer Center gathers a collection of [guides](../guides/overview.md). They show developers how to use Sirius Chain built-in features while following step-by-step use cases.

Each guide comes with at least one snippet. Snippets are executable pieces of code that solve the proposed use case.
