title: Mosaic (SDA)
---

Mosaics, synonomously known as Sirius Digital Asset - SDA - are part of what makes the Smart Asset System unique and flexible. Throughout this document, SDA and mosaic are used interchangeably. SDAs are *fixed assets* on the Sirius Chain that can represent a set of multiple identical things that do not change.

An SDA could be a token, but it could also be a collection of more specialized assets such as reward points, shares of stock, signatures, status flags, votes or even other currencies. A unique token can also be made into a Non-Fungible Token, more commonly known as NFT.

## Properties

Each SDA has a unique identifier and a set of configurable properties. During the [SDA creation](../guides/mosaic/creating-a-mosaic.md), you can define:

| **Property**    | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Divisibility    | Integer  | Determines up to what decimal place the SDA can be divided. Divisibility of 3 means that an SDA can be divided into smallest parts of 0.001 SDAs. The divisibility must be in the range of `0` and `6`. |
| Duration        | Integer  | Specifies the number of confirmed blocks the SDA is rented for. Duration is allowed to lie up to `3650` days (10 years). To create non-expiring SDAs, leave this property undefined.                      |
| Supply mutable  | Boolean  | If set to true, the SDA supply can change at a later point. Otherwise, the SDA supply remains immutable.                                                                                                  |
| Transferability | Boolean  | If set to true, the SDA can be transferred between arbitrary accounts. Otherwise, the SDA can be only transferred back to the SDA creator.                                                             |

## Absolute and relative amounts

Sirius Chain works with absolute amounts, removing the comma when the SDA can be divisible. To get an absolute amount, multiply the amount of assets you want to create or send by ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10^{divisibility}).

For example, if the SDA has divisibility 2, to create or send 10 units (relative) you should define 1000 (absolute) instead.

## Cost

The cost of creating an SDA is configurable per network. By default, it has a cost of `500 xpx` plus transaction fees.

## SDA Levy

A levy allows the creator of an SDA to set a tax on any subsequent transactions of that SDA. This levy is sent to an account of the creators choosing. Any SDA may be used as a levy.

## Example
A private company, ComfyClothingCompany, decides that it wants to go public. Instead of a traditional IPO, the company decides to do an STO to issue tokens through the Sirius Chain platform.

Thus, the company must create an SDA to represent shares to their company. Here is how the company might configure the SDA properties:

 | **Property**   | **Configuration** |
 | -------------- | ----------------- |
 | Duration       | undefined         |
 | Divisibility   | 2                 |
 | Supply mutable | true              |
 | Transferable   | true              |

*Duration*: Shares of the company should exist as long as the company is in business. The ComfyClothingCompany leaves this property *undefined*, creating a non-expiring SDA representing their assets.

*Divisibility*: Although brokerages and investment firms can fractionalize shares, the traditional minimum number of shares an investor can purchase from the open market is 1.

However, Sirius Chain SDAs offer more flexibility in tokenizing their company shares. ComfyClothingCompany chooses the divisibility to be `2`, allowing the smallest fraction of their shares to be 0.01.

Fractional ownership, along with the ability to trade 24/7, brings additional liquidity to the market. These same characteristics also open up the market to smaller investors.

*Supply*: ComfyClothingCompany sets the initial supply of the SDA to a typical startup amount of `10,000,000` authorized shares. As the company grows, it could choose to increase the number of shares, so the supply mutable is set to `true`.

*Transferable*: Once the initial shares are distributed, the shares will be on the market to be traded in public. Thus, the transferability property needs to be set to `true`.

## Tips 

<div class="info">

MosaicId is lower bracket of uint64, therefore the first mosaicId hex is represented by `00` to `7F`. 

Eg. All mosaicId hex will start from `00XXXXXXXXXXXXXX` to `7FXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
