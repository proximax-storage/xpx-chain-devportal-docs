Transfer transactions are used to send [mosaics](./mosaic.md) between two [accounts](./account.md).

## Recipient

The recipient is the address of the [account](./account.md) that receives the transfer transaction.

It is possible to send mosaics to any valid address, even if the address has not previously participated in any transaction.

**Note:**

If nobody owns the private key of the recipient’s account, the funds are most likely lost forever.

## Mosaics

A [mosaic](./mosaic.md) could be a token, but it could also be more specialized assets such as reward points, shares of stock, signatures, status flags, votes or even other currencies.

You can send a combination of different mosaics in the same transaction.

## Message

A transfer transaction can hold a message up to `1023` characters in length, making them suitable for timestamping data permanently on the blockchain.

The messages attached are visible by default to all network participants.

## Encrypted message

Encrypted messages are only accessible by the sender and the recipient.

Sirius Chain uses Bouncy Castle’s AES block cipher implementation in [CBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC) mode to encrypt and decrypt messages.

The client-side handles the encryption and decryption of the message. You can find under the `crypto` module how to encode and decode encrypted messages, but we recommend you to use the available SDK public methods instead.
