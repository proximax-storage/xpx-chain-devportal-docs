[Flatbuffer library](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) defines the protocol to serialize and deserialize Sirius Chain entities. The library comes with code generators for different languages. SDKs and applications use the generated code to interact with REST transaction endpoint.

The library accomplishes the following properties:

## Memory Efficiency

Large networks comprise a large number of transactions. Working with binary optimized in size makes the communication faster. Furthermore, reading entities from memory buffers or just a part of them, is memory efficient.

## Flexibility

REST [transaction endpoints](/endpoints) handle the calls to update the blockchain state. The serialized payload of a transaction is appended to the body of the POST call. These endpoints allow the addition of new functionality to the server side without modifying the API contract.

## Reusability

You can generate transaction's serializer by using the same [defined schema](https://github.com/proximax-storage/go-xpx-chain-sdk/tree/master/transactions/schemas).
