To create a democratized autonomous network, an economic component is essential. Sirius Platform with different actors runs day to day operation concerning its responsibility. Each does work, and to create a fair incentive scheme, the system relies on digital assets.

## Sirius Digial Assets (SDAs)

**[Sirius Storage](overview.md)** uses three types of digital assets that are intended for different purposes.

### Sirius Platform Native Token — XPX

XPX is the native token that fuels the token economy of the Sirius Platform. It's primarily the basis of all internal tokens, and it's pegged to the free market usage of the platform. From the Sirius Storage (or **[SS](overview.md)**) perspective, XPX is the native cryptocurrency to access its ecosystem. XPX is the main currency in the SS. It can be changed to any currency according to market price.

### Storage Units — SO

In Sirius Platform, the core service's economic value relies on the utility tokens the circulate in the respective service ecosystem. In the Sirius Storage ecosystem, Storage units are the utility tokens representing both service capacity and capability. Each storage owner that participants need to stake XPX will be internally exchanged (via Decentralized Internal Exchange Mechanism) to Storage Units. This representation of stake is the agreement that the [Storage Director](roles.md#director-node) node will provide the storage service level and contribute it to the network.

SO is the currency for participation in the [Drive](built_in_features/drive.md). Each [Replicator](roles.md#replicator-node) node should deposit SO to the [Drive](built_in_features/drive.md) account to join it.

### Streaming Units — SM

In Sirius Streaming, SM represents streaming capacity and capability. SM primarily represens the streaming of data from multiple entry sources to one of the multiple sources of exit. SM is the currency for file transfer [rewards](reward.md). Users receive these units for distributing files and pay for getting files.

### Supercontract Units — SC

In Sirius Supercontracts, SC represents execution unit and the amount of unit need is relative to the complexity of the logically computed execution.
