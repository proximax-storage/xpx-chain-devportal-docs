The process of creating new [blocks](./block.md) is called validating.

The validating [account](../built-in-features/account.md) - called the validator - gets the [fees](./transaction.md#fees) for the transactions in the block and [inflation](./inflation.md). This reward gives the validator an incentive to add as many transactions to the block as possible.

## Validating mosaic

Sirius Chain software allows the [definition](https://github.com/proximax-storage/cpp-xpx-chain/blob/master/resources/config-network.properties) of any [mosaic](../built-in-features/mosaic.md) for validating purposes to fit the business needs. The Sirius Chain test network names this mosaic `xpx`.

For example, consortium networks can distribute validating mosaics between the companies that are running the infrastructure, while other participants need to pay fees in the form of [currency mosaic](./transaction.md#fees) to consume services.

By contrast, public networks might decide to use the same mosaic for paying transaction fees and running the network.

## Local validating

During the installation of a [node](./node.md), you will be asked to set up an account that will be used to validate. The [block header](./block.md#blockheader) includes the public key and signature generated by the validating account.

Besides, each node can set a `beneficiary` public key to share a percentage of the validating rewards ([fees](./transaction.md#fees) and [inflation](./inflation.md)), where the sharing ratio is configurable for each network. When the node does not define a beneficiary, all the rewards go to the block signer.

Local validating is secure as long as no one accesses your node instance, which is storing the private key.

## Delegated validating

Delegated validating enables an account to use a proxy private key that can be shared with a node securely. In other words, you can use the importance score of your account to create new blocks without running a node.

After an account activates delegated validating, its importance score is transferred to a remote account. The remote account inherits the importance of the original account.

Security-wise, sharing a proxy private key with a remote node does not compromise the original account since:

- The remote account has zero balance.
- The remote account by itself canâ€™t transfer the importance to another account.
- The original account receives the resulting fees.

Remote validators may not receive the entire reward if the following conditions are met:

The network validating sharing rate is greater than 0.
The node selected has defined a [beneficiary account](#local-validating).

## Schemas

### AccountLinkTransaction

Announce an AccountLinkTransaction to delegate the account to a proxy account. By doing so, you can enable delegated validating.

In order for the proxy account to be accepted as the `remoteAccountKey` for delegated validating, it needs to meet the following conditions:

- It cannot own any mosaics.
- It cannot be a cosignatory of any other account.
- It cannot be a multisig account.
- It cannot already be a delegated account for another account.
- It cannot have its own delegated account.

Furthermore, for the duration that the account is used as a delegated account, it is restricted from:

- initiating any transactions.
- involvement with any type of transactions.
